Hi! I am Gaurav Singh, and this is my website.

Currently I am finishing up my M. Eng. at MIT in Computer Science. I will be a software engineer at Google starting in August 2016.

A little about me. In no order, I:

* grew up in Minnesota.
* did research with [Arkady Yerukhimovich](https://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/cybersec-bios/yerukhimovich-bio.html) on the practicality of functional encryption for my M. Eng, creating [FIFE](https://github.com/gauravjsingh/FIFE) (associated [thesis](/files/meng-thesis.pdf)).
* graduated MIT in 2015 with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science, and a minor in Music.
* lived in [Random Hall](http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/), and was president at one point.
* like singing, listening to music, and occasionally writing music.
* enjoy rock climbing, reading, and hiking.
